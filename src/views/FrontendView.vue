          'For me, it was natural to study frontend after completing my studies in UX and graphic design. My previous studies in UX and graphic design provided me with a solid understanding of user experience and visual design. When I started studying UX, I became curious about programming and how to create digital user interfaces. As frontend development is all about creating the visual interface of a website or application, it felt like a natural next step for me to take. Furthermore, my understanding of UX and graphic design gives me an advantage when it comes to creating user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interfaces.',
